## 🚀 Quick Start

### For Project Stakeholders

1. Read [Requirements](./01-requirements.md) - understand the vision
2. Review [Development Plan](./02-development-plan.md) - see the roadmap
3. Check timeline (20 weeks total, MVP at week 10)

### For Developers

1. Review [Architecture](./03-architecture.md) - understand the system design
2. Study [Database Schema](./04-database-schema.md) - learn the data model
3. Follow [Development Plan](./02-development-plan.md) - execute phase by phase

### To Begin Implementation

1. Set up development environment (see Phase 0 in Development Plan)
2. Create Supabase project
3. Apply database migrations (from Database Schema doc)
4. Initialize Next.js project
5. Start with Phase 0 tasks

---

## 🎯 Project Vision

**JustPlan** enhances the Reclaim.ai concept by adding **customizable Jira-like workflow states** to task management. Instead of just "To-Do" vs "Done", users can define states like:

- Backlog → Ready → In Progress → Review → Done
- With automatic transitions based on conditions (deadline proximity, overdue, time in state)

This provides the benefits of automatic scheduling (like Reclaim.ai) with the flexibility of custom workflows (like Jira), all integrated seamlessly with Google Calendar and Tasks.

## 🔐 Security & Privacy

- **Authentication:** Clerk (Google OAuth, Email, SSO)
- **Multi-tenancy:** Row-Level Security (RLS) in PostgreSQL using Clerk userId
- **Encryption:** TLS in transit, encryption at rest (Supabase)
- **Data Isolation:** Users can only access their own data
- **Token Security:** Google tokens stored encrypted, never exposed to client

---

## 💰 Estimated Costs

**Monthly operating costs (100 users):**

- Vercel: $0-20
- Supabase: $0-25
- Upstash Redis: $0
- Domain: $10
- **Total: $10-55/month**

Scales comfortably to 1,000 users before major infrastructure changes needed.
